Below are frameworks and playbooks that I use to guide my work and my relationships.

### SMART Goals

SMART is a framework for ensuring a goal is well stated.

* Specific
* Measurable
* Actionable
* Relevant
* Time-Bound

Caveats:

* SMART does not test whether the goal itself is a good idea.
* Do not let it enable weak players to set low goals. The setting of tough, demanding, stretching goals that generate the greatest levels of effort and performance.

### 5 Essential Mentorship Questions

What is it that you really want to be and do?

What are you doing really well that is helping you get there?

What are you not doing well that is preventing you from getting there?

What will you do different tomorrow to meet those challenges?

* Someone must have good work ethic and be focused on the right priorities. Otherwise "you're making good time, but you're lost."
* We also show off our best side and hide weaknesses. Probe whether the person has the aptitude to change behavior.

How can I help / where do you need the most help?

### Project retrospectives

Ask did the project achieve its objectives?

Ask did we work according to our principles:

* Work sustainably.
* Follow our engineering principles, e.g. code reviews, unit tests, tackling technical debt when and where it makes us faster, etc.
* Dogfood if applicable.
* Provide strong mentorship for interns.

Ask how happy were you working on this project?

Solicit feedback about the project and team:

* I like... (Things that went well)
* I wish... (Things that we identified did not go well)
* I wonder... (Open-ended questions that, if answered, could provide better outcomes)

Objective assessment:

* What work must still be done?
* Who will own this work?

Lessons learned:

* If we could do this again, what would you wish you'd known from the beginning?
* What would be useful for a related follow-up project?

### OKRs

OKRs are a process for setting, communicating, and monitoring goals and results in organizations.

Objectives:

* Qualitative, not quantitative.
* High-level, derived from upward parent team or company objectives.
* Ambitious, but achievable. Difficult goals are more meaningful.

Key Results:

* Quantitative, with metrics that can be measured and tracked.
* Specific and relevant, describing how to accomplish a related objective.

Guidelines:

* Don't have too many. One per "team" per quarter.
* Review regularly.
* A key result is green if you reach 70% of the stated target.

### RACI Model

The RACI Model is a process for clarifying roles on teams, used in project management.

* Responsible: Who will do the work?
* Accountable: Who has ultimate ownership of the work getting done?
* Consulted: Who must be consulted before a decision or action is taken?
* Informed: Who must be informed that a decision or action is taken?

Steps in a RACI process:

* Create chart mapping activities and deliverables to people
* Each activity should have only one A and one R. A person can be both A and R.
* When a single A or R cannot be identified, decompose the deliverable into smaller deliverables.
* Can have multiple Cs and Is for a deliverable.

### Zones of Collaboration

Zones of Collaboration is a framework to clarify what work your team has control over, and what work your team does not have control over.

Zone 1: What work is your team solely responsible for driving?

* Fully within your control.
* Empower your team to deliver it's best work here.
* Ensure shared understanding between your teams and surrounding teams that your team owns this work.

Zone 2: What work does your team need to influence to be successful?

* Must be involved in this work in some capacity.
* Prioritize. Only stay involved in the work important to your team's impact and success.
* Don't own all the relationships. Delegate to team members who will be most influential, but ensure they're interested.

Zone 3: How is your team interfering with the work of other teams? How are other teams interfering with the work of your team?

* Ideally there is no work in this zone.
* This can be work that one team used to own but no longer owns and is having a tough time moving away from it.
* Protect your team from interference by other teams to ensure that your team delivers great work.

### Mastery, Autonomy, and Purpose

From the book [Drive](drive.markdown) by Daniel Pink. These are the things that intrinsically motivate us.

* Mastery
* Autonomy
* Purpose

### [Radical Candor](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/)

Radical candor is a simple tool for ensuring that your team gets the right kind of guidance.

It has a graph with two axes:

* The vertical axis is "Care personally," or the "give a damn" axis.
* The horizontal axis is "Challenge directly," or the "willing to piss people off" axis.

With four quadrants:

* Top-right, or caring personally and challenging directly, is radical candor. This is best.
* Bottom-right, or challenging directly without caring personally, is obnoxious aggression. This is second best.
* Top-left, or caring personally without challenging directly, is ruinous empathy. This is where most of us are.
* Bottom-left, without caring personally or challenging directly, is manipulative insincerity.

Delivering radical candor is HHIPP:

* Humble
* Helpful
* Immediate
* In person (private if it's criticism, public if it's praise)
* Doesn't personalize

### [Faultlines](https://www.groupoe.com/blog-on-teams/146-faultlines-can-divide-your-team-be-aware-and-be-smart.html)

A dividing line that splits what is supposed to be a single, unified team into two or more subgroups.

* Education
* Authority
* Family (e.g. members of the company's founding family vs others)
* Age
* Geography

Addressing faultlines:

* Establish and emphasize shared goals that all team members can embrace.
* Use "connectors," or someone who shares something in common with multiple groups.

### [GROW Model](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_89.htm)

GROW is a model for structuring your coaching or mentoring sessions.

Goal:

* Make it SMART.
* Ask how the person will know when the goal is achieved.

Reality:

* Understand ongoing conflicts with the goal.
* Ask what steps have been taken toward the goal.

Options (or Obstacles):

* Help brainstorm and provide guidance, but do not make the decisions.
* Weigh the pros and cons of each.
* Ask what the person must stop doing to achieve the goal.

Will (or Way Forward):

* Create commitment to specific actions in order to move toward the goal.
* Ask how to keep motivated.
* Decide when to review progress.

### [SBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oRKr5xA9N0)

SBI is a framework that promotes feedback based on identifying behavior and impact in a specific situation.

First, always ask for permission to give feedback.

Situation:

* When and where something occurred.
* Be specific.

Behavior:

* What had an effect on you.
* Again, be specific.

Impact:

* Describes your emotional response and is particular to you.
* Start this with "I felt..."

### Types of "Yes"

From the book [Never Split the Difference](never-split-the-difference.markdown) by Chris Voss. There are three types of "yes" that someone gives:

* Counterfeit: Where your counterpart feels it is an escape route or uses it to continue the conversation for some edge.
* Confirmation: A reflexive response to a black-and-white question, a simple affirmation with no promise of action.
* Commitment: A true agreement that leads to action.

### Attributing irrationality

From the book [Never Split the Difference](never-split-the-difference.markdown) by Chris Voss. If someone appears to be acting irrationally, consider:

* Either person may have incomplete information.
* That person is operating under constraints that he or she is not eager to reveal.
* That person is complying with needs or desires based on his or her own rules or worldview.

### [BICEPS model](https://www.palomamedina.com/biceps)

BICEPS is a model for representing one's core needs. Use it so that others feel understood and valued.

Belonging

* Community: A feeling of friendship and closeness with a group.
* Community well-being: People feel cared for and happy.
* Connection: Feeling mutual understanding with another person.

Improvement/Progress

* Progress towards purpose: Moving toward a goal for the company, team, or yourself.
* Improving the lives of others.
* Personal growth: Growth in yourself in skills that matter to you.

Choice

* Choice: Having control over key parts of your world.
* Autonomy: Having clear ownership with no need to ask for permission.
* Ability to make decisions about what matters to you.

Equality/Fairness

* Access to resources (money, time, space, etc) feels equitable.
* Access to information is fair.
* You support each other equally.
* Decisions are fair and everyone is treated as equally important.

Predictability

* There's certainty about resources (money, space, etc) to focus on your job.
* There's certainty about when things will happen and when you can prepare.
* You can anticipate and thus prepare for future challenges.
* Goals, strategy, and direction don't change too fast.

Status

* Status: You hold a title or role that honors your worth.
* Your work is highly visible to people that matter.
* Your work is recognized and appreciated in positive ways.
