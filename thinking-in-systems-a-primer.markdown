## Thinking in Systems: A Primer

by Donella H. Meadows

### Part 1: System Structure and Behavior

#### Ch 1: The Basics

##### More Than the Sum of Its Parts

* A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. It consists of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose.
* There is an integrity or wholeness about a system and an active set of mechanisms to maintain that integrity.
* The system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.

##### Look Beyond the Players to the Rules of the Game

* The elements of a system are often the easiest parts to notice, because many of them are visible, tangible things. But intangibles can also be elements.
* Many interconnections in a system are flows of information, or signals that go to decision or action points. Information holds systems together and greatly determines how they operate.
* The purpose of a system is deduced from its behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals. One important purpose of almost every system is to ensure its own perpetuation.
* Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems.
* A system generally goes on being itself, changing only slowly if at all, even with complete substitutions of its elements – as long as its interconnections and purposes remain intact.
* The elements are often the least important in defining the unique characteristics of the system, unless changing an element also changes relationships or purpose.

##### Bathtubs 101 – Understanding System Behavior over Time

* Stocks are the elements of a system that you can see, feel, count, or measure. They are a store, quantity, or accumulation of material or information that has built up over time.
* Stocks change over time through the actions flows. A stock is therefore a memory of the history of changing flows within the system.
* Understanding the dynamics of stocks and flows reveals much about a complex system's behavior. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, a stock does not change.
* We focus more on inflows than outflows, but a stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as increasing its inflow rate.
* A stock takes time to change, even when the flows into our out of them change suddenly. Stocks therefore act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in a system.
* The time lags that come from slowly changing stocks can cause problems, but also provide stability. They allow room to maneuver, to experiment, and to revise policies that aren't working.
* Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and to be independent and temporarily out of balance with one another.
* Most individual and institutional decisions are designed to regulate the levels of stocks. System thinkers see the world as stocks with the mechanisms for regulating their levels by manipulating flows.

##### How the System Runs Itself – Feedback

* Feedback loops permit behaviors that persist over time. Such a loop is formed when a change in stock affects the flows into our out of that same stock.
* Feedback loops can cause stocks to maintain their levels within a range or grow or decline.

##### Stabilizing Loops – Balancing Feedback

* Balancing feedback loops are goal-seeking or stability-seeking. They keep a stock at a given value or range of values. They oppose whatever change is imposed on the system.

##### Runaway Loops – Reinforcing Feedback

* A reinforcing feedback loop enhances whatever direction of change is imposed on it, thereby creating a virtuous or vicious cycle of healthy growth or runaway destruction.
* Reinforcing loops are found wherever a system element can reproduce itself or grow as a constant fraction of itself. It leads to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time.
* Ask yourself: "If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?" Feedback opens up the idea that a system can cause its own behavior.
