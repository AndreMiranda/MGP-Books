## Thinking in Systems: A Primer

by Donella H. Meadows

### Part 1: System Structure and Behavior

#### Ch 1: The Basics

##### More Than the Sum of Its Parts

* A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. It consists of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose.
* There is an integrity or wholeness about a system and an active set of mechanisms to maintain that integrity.
* The system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.

##### Look Beyond the Players to the Rules of the Game

* The elements of a system are often the easiest parts to notice, because many of them are visible, tangible things. But intangibles can also be elements.
* Many interconnections in a system are flows of information, or signals that go to decision or action points. Information holds systems together and greatly determines how they operate.
* The purpose of a system is deduced from its behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals. One important purpose of almost every system is to ensure its own perpetuation.
* Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems.
* A system generally goes on being itself, changing only slowly if at all, even with complete substitutions of its elements – as long as its interconnections and purposes remain intact.
* The elements are often the least important in defining the unique characteristics of the system, unless changing an element also changes relationships or purpose.

##### Bathtubs 101 – Understanding System Behavior over Time

* Stocks are the elements of a system that you can see, feel, count, or measure. They are a store, quantity, or accumulation of material or information that has built up over time.
* Stocks change over time through the actions flows. A stock is therefore a memory of the history of changing flows within the system.
* Understanding the dynamics of stocks and flows reveals much about a complex system's behavior. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, a stock does not change.
* We focus more on inflows than outflows, but a stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as increasing its inflow rate.
* A stock takes time to change, even when the flows into our out of them change suddenly. Stocks therefore act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in a system.
* The time lags that come from slowly changing stocks can cause problems, but also provide stability. They allow room to maneuver, to experiment, and to revise policies that aren't working.
* Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and to be independent and temporarily out of balance with one another.
* Most individual and institutional decisions are designed to regulate the levels of stocks. System thinkers see the world as stocks with the mechanisms for regulating their levels by manipulating flows.

##### How the System Runs Itself – Feedback

* Feedback loops permit behaviors that persist over time. Such a loop is formed when a change in stock affects the flows into our out of that same stock.
* Feedback loops can cause stocks to maintain their levels within a range or grow or decline.

##### Stabilizing Loops – Balancing Feedback

* Balancing feedback loops are goal-seeking or stability-seeking. They keep a stock at a given value or range of values. They oppose whatever change is imposed on the system.

##### Runaway Loops – Reinforcing Feedback

* A reinforcing feedback loop enhances whatever direction of change is imposed on it, thereby creating a virtuous or vicious cycle of healthy growth or runaway destruction.
* Reinforcing loops are found wherever a system element can reproduce itself or grow as a constant fraction of itself. It leads to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time.
* Ask yourself: "If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?" Feedback opens up the idea that a system can cause its own behavior.

##### One-Stock Systems

*A Stock with Two Competing Balancing Loops – a Thermostat*

* A furnace cannot heat a room to a target temperature because heat leaks to the outside. This leak drains away some heat even as the furnace is getting the signal to put it back.
* The information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect future behavior; it can't deliver a signal fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback.
* This means that a flow can't react instantly to a flow. It can only react to a change in stock, and only after a slight delay to register the incoming information.
* A stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop must have its goal set to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect the stock. Otherwise the process will fall short or exceed the target.
* Every feedback loop has its breakdown point, where other loops pull the stock away from its goal more strongly than it can pull back.

*A Stock with One Reinforcing Loop and One Balancing Loop – Population and Industrial Economy*

* Because systems often have several competing feedback loops operating simultaneously, those loops that dominate the system will determine its behavior.
* Complex behaviors of systems often arise as the relative strengths of feedback loops shift, causing first one loop and then another to dominate the behavior.
* To test the value of a model, ask: Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way? If they did, would the system react this way? What is driving the driving factors?
* Model utility depends on not whether its driving scenarios are realistic (since no one can know that for sure), but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behavior.
* Population has a reinforcing loop of births and a balancing loop of deaths. Capital has a reinforcing loop of investment of output and a balancing loop of depreciation.
* A central question of economic development is how to keep the reinforcing loop of capital accumulation growing more slowly than the reinforcing loop of population growth, so that people are getting richer instead of poorer.

*A System with Delays – Business Inventory*

* A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes a system likely to oscillate.
* Changes in stock while waiting for a flow to change can lead us to overreact. If the change in flow is more than expected then we can overreact again and change the flow too much in the other direction.
* Delays are strong determinants of behavior, and so we can't begin to understand the dynamic behavior of systems unless we know where and how long the delays are.
* Economies are extremely complex systems; they are full of balancing feedback loops with delays, and they are inherently oscillatory.

##### Two-Stock Systems

*A Renewable Stock Constrained by a Nonrenewable Stock – an Oil Company*

* Any real physical entity is always exchanging things with its environment, and so any physical, growing system is going to eventually run into some sort of constraint.
* This constraint takes the form of a balancing loop that shifts the dominance of the reinforcing loop driving the growth, either by strengthening the outflow or weakening the inflow.
* Growth in a constrained environment is called the "limits-to-growth" archetype.
* The more capital, the higher the extraction rate, the lower the resource stock, the lower the yield per unit of capital, the lower the profit, the lower the investment rate, and so the lower growth rate of capital.
* When you're building a capital stock dependent on a nonrenewable resource, the higher and faster you grow, the farther and faster you fall.
* The real choice in the management of a nonrenewable resource is whether to get rich very fast or to get less rich but stay that way longer.
* Raising the price of the resource gives the industry higher profits, so investment goes up, capital stock continues rising, and the more costly resources can be extracted.

*Renewable Stock Constrained by a Renewable Stock – a Fishing Economy*

* A simplified model is affected by three non-linear relationships: price (scarcer fish cost more), regeneration rate (scarcer fish breed less), and yield per unit of capital (efficiency of fishing).
* Nonrenewable resources are stock-limited: The entire stock is available at once and can be extracted at any rate, and so the faster you extract, the shorter its lifetime.
* Renewable resources are flow-limited: The stock supports indefinite extraction at a rate equal to its regeneration rate, or else the resource may be driven below a threshold and become non-renewable.
* More and more, increases in technology and harvest efficiency have the ability to drive resource populations to extinction.
* If the balancing feedback loop is weak, so that capital grows even as the resource dips below its threshold ability to regenerate itself, the resource and industry both collapse.
