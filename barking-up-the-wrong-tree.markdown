## Barking Up the Wrong Tree

by Eric Barker

### Chapter 1: Should We Play It Safe and Do What We're Told If We Want to Succeed?

* Schools reward students who consistently do what they're told. Grades correlate loosely with intelligence, but strongly with self-discipline and compliance.
* Schools reward being a generalist. Unlike the real world, there is little recognition of student passion or expertise.
* Following the rules doesn't create success; it just eliminates extremes, both good and bad.
* There are two types of leaders: "Filtered" ones who rise up through formal channels, and "unfiltered" ones who come in through the window.
* A minority of unfiltered candidates are transformative, turning away organizations from misguided beliefs and foolish inconsistencies.
* Unfiltered leaders have "intensifiers," or qualities that are often negative in the mean, but become positives in a specific context.
* The "differential susceptibility hypothesis" says that the same genes that lead to bad stuff can actually lead to good stuff in a different situation.
* A "hopeful monster" is an individual that deviates radically from the norm because of a mutation that confers a potentially adaptive advantage.
* Too often we label things "good" or "bad," when the right designation might merely be "different."
* To be great we must be different. And that doesn't come from trying to follow society's vision of what's best, because society doesn't always know what it needs. More often being the best means being the best version of you.
* Anything better aligned to fit a unique scenario is going to be problematic on average. And qualities that are "generally good" can be bad at the extremes.
* We try to filter out the worst to increase the average, but by doing this we also decrease variance.
* Often intensifiers masquerade as positives because we give successful people the benefit of the doubt, or label them as "eccentric."
* To apply "Leadership Filtration Theory," first, *know thyself*. Know whether you are filtered or unfiltered, and know your strengths, or what you are good at that produces desired results.
* Second, *pick the right pond*. Choose companies and situations so that you can leverage your type, your signature strengths, and your context to create value.
