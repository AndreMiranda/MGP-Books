## When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing

by Daniel Pink

### Part 1: The Day

#### Chapter 1: The Hidden Pattern of Everyday Life

* Human beings metaphorically "open" and "close" at regular times during each day, but those times aren't identical for everyone.
* During a given day we are typically least happy when commuting, and most happy when canoodling.
* Our cognitive abilities do not remain static over the day, but change, often in a regular, forseeable manner.
* These fluctuations are extreme, and the best time to perform a task depends on the nature of the task.
* Waking up raises our body temperature; for most of us this boosts our executive functioning so that our analytic capacities peak in the late morning or around noon.
* But our mental guards grow tired, and alertness plummets in the afternoons, which in turn reduces our ability to remain focused and constrain our inhibitions.
* A "flash of brilliance" required to solve an insight problem is more likely to happen when those guards are gone.
* Each of us has a "chronotype," or a personal pattern of circadian rhythms that influences our physiology and psychology.
* We are either a lark (early to rise), an owl (late to sleep), or a third bird (the rest, which is 60%-80% of the population).
* Larks and third birds experience the day as a peak, a trough, and a rebound. Owls experience it as a recovery, a trough, and a peak.
* Try to schedule your most important work, which requires clear thinking, into the peak. Schedule tasks that benefit from disinhibition into the rebound.

#### Chapter 1: Time Hacker's Handbook

* If you don't have full control over your schedule, simply understanding your chronotype and shaping the little things can minimize any harm.
* Exercise in the morning to lose weight, boost mood, keep to your routine, and build strength.
* Exercise in the evening to avoid injury, perform your best, and enjoy the workout a bit more.
* In the morning, drink water to rehydrate and control early hunger pangs.
* Only drink coffee 60-90 minutes after you've woken up, so that it doesn't interfere with producing cortisol, which wakes us up naturally.
* Schedule therapy sessions in the morning when your cortisol levels are highest; you will be more focused and absorb the advice more deeply.

#### Chapter 2: Afternoons and Coffee Spoons

* A "vigilance break" is a brief pause before a high-stakes encounter to review instructions and guard against any error.
* Regardless of our chronotype, the afternoon impairs our professional and ethical judgment.
* Inserting regular mandatory vigilance breaks into our tasks can help us regain the focus needed to proceed with challenging work in the afternoon.
* A restorative break can steer around the dangers of the trough.
* The best restorative breaks prefer moving over stationary, social over solo, outside over inside, and full detached over semi-detached.
* Most of the research showing the value of breakfast are observational studies rather than randomized controlled experiments.
* The best lunch breaks have a high degree of autonomy and detachment, and offer an important recovery setting to promote occupational health and well-being.
* Naps confer two key benefits: They improve cognitive performance and they boost mental and physical health.
* Ideal naps are between ten and twenty minutes; any longer and the napper experiences "sleep inertia," or that boggy feeling upon awakening.
* Caffeine takes about 25 minutes to enter the bloodstream, and so drinking coffee before taking your short nap helps you rebound quickly.

#### Chapter 2: Time Hacker's Handbook

* The Mayo Clinic has found that the best time to nap is between 2pm and 3pm.
* Drinking coffee and then setting a timer on your phone for 25 minutes to wake you is ideal, since it takes most people about 7 minutes to fall asleep.
* A good micro-break is the 20-20-20 rule: Every twenty minutes, look at something twenty feet away for twenty seconds.
* If you can't take a break outside, do the best you can by looking at some indoor plants or the trees outside your window.
* A fringe benefit of a social break is that you're more likely to take one if someone else is counting on you.
* Controlled breathing can help in under a minute: Take a deep breath, expanding your belly, pause, exhale slowly to the count of five, and repeat four times.
* When you and your team need to plow forward and get a job done even when in the trough, employ a vigilance break that combines a timeout with a checklist.

### Part 2: Beginnings, Endings, and In Between

#### Chapter 3: Beginnings

* When we begin can have an outsize role in our personal and collective fortunes.
* The three principles of successful beginnings are: Start right, start again, and start together.
* Starting right means starting at the right time; this is difficult because we don't take issues of _when_ as seriously as we take issues of _what_.
* Starting again leverages temporal landmarks to stand out from the ceaseless march of other days. They are either social (which are shared) or personal.
* Temporal landmarks allow us to open "new mental accounts," creating a new period that disconnects us from the past self's mistakes and imperfections.
* Temporal landmarks also slow our thinking, allowing us to deliberate at a higher level and make better decisions.
* Earning more requires matching your skills to an employer's needs, but those who enter the labor market in a downturn are stuck longer in jobs that aren't a good match for their skills.
* Starting together means engaging the wider community or ecosystem so that vulnerable people do not need to fend for themselves.

#### Chapter 3: Time Hacker's Handbook

* By imagining failure in advance, you can anticipate some of the potential sources and avoid them once the actual project begins.
* Go first if you're on a ballot, you're not the default choice, there are relatively few competitors (at most five), or you're going against several strong candidates.
* Don't go first if you are the default choice, there are many competitors, you're operating in an uncertain environment, or the competition is meager.
* When starting a new job, mentally picture yourself "becoming" a new person and "transforming" into your new role, especially for leadership roles.
* After starting a new job, set up and collect small wins. Later, once you've gained status by demonstrating excellence, become more assertive.
* Past the age of 32, the odds of divorce increase by 5 percent per year for at least the next decade.
* The more a couple spends on its wedding day and any engagement ring, the more likely they are to divorce.
