## When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing

by Daniel Pink

### Part 1: The Day

#### Chapter 1: The Hidden Pattern of Everyday Life

* Human beings metaphorically "open" and "close" at regular times during each day, but those times aren't identical for everyone.
* During a given day we are typically least happy when commuting, and most happy when canoodling.
* Our cognitive abilities do not remain static over the day, but change, often in a regular, forseeable manner.
* These fluctuations are extreme, and the best time to perform a task depends on the nature of the task.
* Waking up raises our body temperature; for most of us this boosts our executive functioning so that our analytic capacities peak in the late morning or around noon.
* But our mental guards grow tired, and alertness plummets in the afternoons, which in turn reduces our ability to remain focused and constrain our inhibitions.
* A "flash of brilliance" required to solve an insight problem is more likely to happen when those guards are gone.
* Each of us has a "chronotype," or a personal pattern of circadian rhythms that influences our physiology and psychology.
* We are either a lark (early to rise), an owl (late to sleep), or a third bird (the rest, which is 60%-80% of the population).
* Larks and third birds experience the day as a peak, a trough, and a rebound. Owls experience it as a recovery, a trough, and a peak.
* Try to schedule your most important work, which requires clear thinking, into the peak. Schedule tasks that benefit from disinhibition into the rebound.

#### Chapter 1: Time Hacker's Handbook

* If you don't have full control over your schedule, simply understanding your chronotype and shaping the little things can minimize any harm.
* Exercise in the morning to lose weight, boost mood, keep to your routine, and build strength.
* Exercise in the evening to avoid injury, perform your best, and enjoy the workout a bit more.
* In the morning, drink water to rehydrate and control early hunger pangs.
* Only drink coffee 60-90 minutes after you've woken up, so that it doesn't interfere with producing cortisol, which wakes us up naturally.
* Schedule therapy sessions in the morning when your cortisol levels are highest; you will be more focused and absorb the advice more deeply.
